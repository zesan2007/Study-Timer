Hi, I'm Md. Mahmudur Rahman Zesan from Bangladesh (HSC '27), and this is the study tool I built for myself.I needed a system that cut through distractions and simply worked. Study Focus is my answer: a clean, minimalist web app centered on the principle of staying consistent—because even a $1\%$ improvement every day compounds into massive success.Key Features:The Timer: A straightforward session timer with Start, Pause, and Reset functionality to keep you locked into deep work.Monthly Progress: Track your dedication with a visible Monthly Total hour count right on the screen.Ambient Music Integration: I built a seamless YouTube player. Just paste a YouTube link or ID to instantly load your favorite lo-fi beats, ambient music, or white noise.True Focus Mode: The killer feature: You can Play the video for the audio, then hit Hide. The music keeps playing in the background while the visual distraction is gone, letting you achieve true concentration.Customization: Set your vibe by applying a custom background image URL for a personalized study space.This tool is simple, distraction-free, and designed to help me—and you—master the art of consistent study.
